    <h1>First K steps of miniature chess games</h1>
    <div id="observablehq-viewof-sunburst-3f8d7bf2"></div>
    <h2 id="our-plans">Our Plans</h2>
    <p> We plan to do the following:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Show a sunburst chart of first moves of Miniature Chess Games</li>
      <li>There is no guidance on short games, people focus on games of top players instead of short games</li>
      <li>We want which miniatures are popular on lichess therefore preparing our audience either to play a minature or see it when someone tries it the trick on them the next time they play.</li>
      <li>We plan to also show a chess board on the right with the moves shown as the game progresses move by move when one hovers/clicks on the sunburst.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Toolchain</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>We collect games played on lichess excess of 30 GB of data</li>
      <li>We filter out the short games (between 3 and 15 moves)</li>
      <li>We use these on the sunburst.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>All comments welcome!</h2>
    <p>Our sunburst is not ready yet, but this is a peek at what will be in our final version. We will need at least another week to add a lot more to this website.</p>
