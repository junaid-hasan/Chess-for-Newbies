# Chess for Newbies

## What is Chess?
Chess is a two player game on 64 squares. It has gained huge popularity post COVID, and the popular Netflix show <a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/80234304"> The Queen's Gambit</a>

## What we want to study?
Existing Chess tutorials and websites involve a bare minimum knowledge of basic chess openings, and an understanding of common traps and also a knowledge of how valuable each piece is (For example Rooks are move valuable than knights).

We wanted to focus on the beginner players, who are completely new to chess, and they are only assumed to know the basic moves of the chess pieces.

Moreover, we want to look at miniature games (less than 15 moves) and showcase some common traps and tricks.

This will help them understand why the current openings are as they are, and also help them get some quick advantage and some quick success against fellow beginner players.

We do this via a sunburst plot which shows how common the move is in the lichess database among miniature games.
