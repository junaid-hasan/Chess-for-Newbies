We plan to do the following:

1.  Show a sunburst chart of first moves of Miniature Chess Games
2.  There is no guidance on short games, people focus on games of top players instead of short games
3.  We want which miniatures are popular on lichess therefore preparing our audience either to play a minature or see it when someone tries it the trick on them the next time they play.
4.  We plan to also show a chess board on the right with the moves shown as the game progresses move by move when one hovers/clicks on the sunburst.

Toolchain
---------

1.  We collect games played on lichess excess of 30 GB of data
2.  We filter out the short games (between 3 and 15 moves)
3.  We use these on the sunburst.

All comments welcome!
---------------------

Our sunburst is not ready yet, but this is a peek at what will be in our final version. We will need at least another week to add a lot more to this website.
